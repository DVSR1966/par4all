You are in the master branch of Par4All... that is not used in the
project! :-)

You should go in the p4a branch to look at the development branch with:
git checkout p4a
and look at the documentation there or on-line about the branch
organization in Par4All.

Or you can switch to the tag of some specific version.

If you want to develop inside Par4All, switch to the p4a-own branch.
