Effects for AMBIGUOUS01 are first expressed in BAR scope

C               <must be written>: BAR:I
      PROGRAM AMBIGUOUS01
C               <must be written>: BAR:I

C     Purpose: to show that effects on I are not translated in a unique way.
C     Its name depends on the parsing order.

      CALL FOO                                                          0001
