Release notes for Par4All 0.2, 2010/06/30
=========================================

Ronan Keryell, HPC Project.

Par4All is an open-source environment to do source-to-source
transformations on C and Fortran programs for parallelizing, optimizing,
instrumenting, reverse-engineering, etc. on various targets, from embedded
multiprocessor system-on-chip with hardware accelerators up to high
performance computer and GPU.


Introduction
------------

This is the first public version of Par4All. It parallelizes C programs to
OpenMP and CUDA, and Fortran programs to OpenMP.

More documentation and information is available on http://par4all.org.

For support you can mail to: support at par4all dot org

This release presents basic features of Par4All and PIPS. If you need more
complex transformations, parallelizations and optimizations, you may
contact HPC Project for professional support.

The main user interface in Par4All is the command-line interface ``p4a``
to invoke parallelization of the provided source codes, but also back-end
compilation or automatic ``CMakeFile`` generation.

But the other commands from the PIPS project included in Par4All are also
available: ``tpips`` and ``ipyps``. Of course, they are reserved for quite
more advised users. For more information, look at http://pips4u.org


Installation
------------

You can install Par4All in different ways, more or less automatic. The
installation is done into ``/usr/local/par4all``. If you want Par4All
installed in another location, use the compilation way at the end of this
section.

The best way if you are on GNU/Linux Debian or Ubuntu is to use
our package repository. This way, when a new version is out, your
classical package manager can automatically install it.

To use our package repository, pick *one* of the following lines, and
add it graphically with the *Update Manager* with
*Settings...*/*Third-Party Software* or append it with a text editor to
your ``/etc/apt/sources.list``::

  deb http://download.par4all.org/ubuntu releases main
  deb http://download.par4all.org/ubuntu nightly main
  deb http://download.par4all.org/debian releases main
  deb http://download.par4all.org/debian nightly main

Nightly packages are generated every night, and is best suited if you want
to track closely Par4All development. The stability is not guaranteed with
nightly builds.

Once this is done, run::

  sudo aptitude update
  sudo aptitude install par4all

And you are (almost) good to go! You will need to source a shell script as
described when you issue the ``aptitude install par4all`` command,
or log out and log in again for the environment to get properly set
up for Par4All. Once this is done, you can, for example, run ``p4a -h``
to get help about the usage of the ``p4a`` frontend script.

A less automatic way on Debian or Linux is to install the Par4All
``.deb`` package you have found on http://download.par4all.org with::

  sudo gdebi <the_package>.deb

``sudo dpkg -i <the_package>.deb`` would also work but does not
automatically install dependencies you should install later.

An even less automatic way is to use a tar ball ``.tar.gz`` file. It
contains the binaries as built on a stable Ubuntu or Debian
distribution. It should work on any GNU/Linux distribution with the
following libraries installed: (a fairly recent) ``libc.so.6``,
``libncurses.so.5``, ``libreadline.so.6``

Once you have downloaded one of these ``.tar.gz`` packages from
http://download.par4all.org, extract it with the following command::

  tar xvzf <the_package>.tar.gz

It will create a directory named ``par4all``. Move this directory to its final
location::

  sudo mv par4all /usr/local/

You will then need to source one of the following shell scripts which set up
the environment variables for proper Par4All execution:

  - if you use ``bash``, ``sh``, ``dash``, etc.::

      source /usr/local/par4all/etc/par4all-rc.sh

  - if you use ``csh``, ``tcsh``, etc.::

      source /usr/local/par4all/etc/par4all-rc.csh

Then you can look at the manual of ``p4a`` on
http://www.par4all.org/documentation for information on how to use Par4All.

More details on the installation or how to compile Par4All from your own
can be found into the document describing all the infrastructure:

Fortran
-------

The support for Fortran95 is not included in this release since it was not
mature enough at this release time, so only Fortran 77 with some
extensions is currently accepted.

Fortran95 support should be in the 2010/09 release.


C
-

Full C99 support is almost complete but right now there are nevertheless
few known limitationsÂ :

- variables in functions can only be defined at the beginning of a block,
  before any normal statement (like in C89)

- for a similar reason, loop index variable can not be declared directly
  in the loop such according the C99 syntax as in::

    {
      [...]
      for(int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        [...]
      }
      [...]
    }

  but should be replaced with the C89 syntax as::

    {
      int i;
      [...]
      for(i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        [...]
      }
      [...]
    }

- you should avoid heavy use of pointers to enable a good
  parallelization. The point-to analysis is still on-going in PIPS

- there are still issues in the part that analyzes the control graph (the
  PIPS ``controlizer``). For example, right now we cannot deal well with a
  different hierarchy between the control graph and the variable
  scoping. For example if you have a block with a variable declaration
  within and a ``goto`` to/from outside, it may probably fail. This
  happens also if you have ``break`` or ``continue`` in loops with some local
  variables since those are internally represented with ``goto``.

Full C99 support should be in the 2010/09 release.


Cuda
----

To compile and to run the CUDA output, you should have the following
environment variables set:

- ``CUDA_DIR`` to the directory where CUDA has been installed (default to
  ``/usr/local/cuda``)

- ``CUDA_SDK_DIR`` to where the CUDA SDK has been installed (default to
  ``$HOME/NVIDIA_GPU_Computing_SDK``)

- ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` should contains at least ``$CUDA_DIR/lib64``

Sometimes, Par4All generates C99 array parameter declarations in the
generated CUDA kernels that are not yet dealt with nvcc 3.0. To avoid this
we apply an array to pointer transformation on generated kernels. We hope
nVidia will release soon a CUDA version that is C99-compliant as OpenCL
is. That means that in the mean time, the entry code should not contain
this kind of C99 function declaration::

  f_type my_function(size_t n, size_t m, float array[n][m]) {
     ...
  }

 instead you may have::

  f_type my_function(float array[n][m]) {
     ...
  }

with ``n`` and ``m`` that may be global variables, ``enum`` value or
``#define``.


Embedded systems
----------------

The code generation for the Scaleo Chip Leon 3 MP-SoC is done through the
OpenMP support of the target.


SIMD and multimedia extensions
------------------------------

The SIMD (SSE) output is not included in this release yet since it was not
ready at release time but should be in the 2010/09 release.


Python
------

On Debian, PLY seems to be installed only with Python 2.5. It works with
Python 2.6 and 3.1 with the ``PYTHONPATH`` generated for Par4All (with a
trailing ``:/usr/share/pyshared``). Unfortunately this breaks ``ipyps``.
