When the transformer for the empty path is identity:
int main()
{
   int i = 0, k1 = 0, k2 = 42, k3 = 0;
   k1++;
sb:   k2++;
   k3++;
   return i;
}
The path transformer between Sbegin and Send is
arguments:relation: 
 { 
 } 
When The transformer for the empty path is false:
int main()
{
   int i = 0, k1 = 0, k2 = 42, k3 = 0;
   k1++;
sb:   k2++;
   k3++;
   return i;
}
The path transformer between Sbegin and Send is
arguments:relation: 
 { 
 1  == -1 ,
 }
