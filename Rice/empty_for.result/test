Select some options to deal with th C Language:
Parse as C:
Prettyprint the source as C, of course
Do not display original number lines as comment:
If possible, transform simple for-loops into do-loop Ã  la Fortran, simpler to analyze:
Desugaring other for-loops into plain while-loops fot the time we improve semantics ameliorations in PIPS:
Select the most precise analysis:
Compute the intraprocedural preconditions at the same time as
transformers and use them to improve the accuracy of expression
and statement transformers:
Try to restructure the code for more precision:
Privatize scalar variables on all the modules of the program:
Ask for some statistics about the job to be done:
Ask for the parallelization of all the modules of the program with OpenMP output:
enum {N=9};
typedef struct {float re; float im;} complex;
complex imagein[N][N];
extern int main(int argc, char *argv[]);
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
   int i;
   int j;
   int k;

#pragma omp parallel for private(j)
   for(i = 0; i <= 8; i += 1)
#pragma omp parallel for 
      for(j = 0; j <= 8; j += 1)
         ;

   return 0;
}
