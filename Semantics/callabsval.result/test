      PROGRAM CALLABSVAL

C  P() {}


c     bug: results are better in absval than in callabsval because
c     the absval transformer does not take the test condition into account

c     note also that preconditions in the test branches are not symmetrical
c     because 0 belongs to the [-1..1] interval and because the condition
c     .lt. is more precise when n is negative

      I = 1                                                             0001

C  P(I) {I==1}

      CALL ABSVAL(I, IABS)                                              0002

C  P(I,IABS) {I==1, 1<=IABS}

      I = -1                                                            0003

C  P(I,IABS) {I==-1, 1<=IABS}

      CALL ABSVAL(I, IABS)                                              0004

C  P(I,IABS) {I==-1, 1<=IABS}

      PRINT *, I, IABS                                                  0005
