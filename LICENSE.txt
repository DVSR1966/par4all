Unless other licenses are specified for some files or directories (PIPS,
PolyLib, gcc...), this license applies to the Par4All content.

More specifically, Par4All gathers some other projects as git subtrees in
its own repository to ease distribution and integration and they have
their own licenses, for example:
- packages/PIPS (with linear, newgen, pips...) is GPL v3;
- packages/pips-gfc/gcc-4.4.5 is a mix of GPL v2, GPL v3, GCC runtime
  library exception, LGPL v2 and LGPL v3;
- packages/polylib is GPL v3;
- examples/Benchmarks/polybenchs is GPL v3;
- examples/Benchmarks/rodinia is under a license from the University of
  Virginia described in examples/Benchmarks/rodinia/LICENSE.
