  @param c is a the simple cell for which we look an equivalent constant path
  @param ptl is the list of points-to in which we search for constant paths
  @param  exact_p is a pointer towards a boolean. It is set to true if
         the result is exact, and to false if it is an approximation,
	 either because the matching points-to sources found in ptl are
	 over-approximations of the preceding path of input_ref or because
	 the matching points-to have MAY approximation tag.
  @return a list of constant path cells. It is a list because at a given
          program point the cell may correspond to several constant paths.


  original comment:
  goal: see if cell c can be shortened by replacing its indirections
  by their values when they are defined in ptl. For instance, p[0][0]
  and (p,q,EXACT) is reduced to q[0]. And if (q,i,EXACT) is also
  available, the reference is reduced to i. The reduced cell is less likely
  to be invalidated by a write effect. The function is called "eval"
  because its goal is to build an as constant as possible reference or
  gap.

  I currently assume that points-to sinks are constant paths because
  in the last example we should also have (p[0], i, EXACT) in the
  points-to list. (BC)

  This function is called by effects to see if a memory access path
  can be transformed into a constant. It should also be called by the
  points-to analysis to see if a sink or a source can be preserved in
  spite of write effects. This function should be called before
  points_to_filter_effects() to reduce the number of anywhere
  locations generated.
