  For historical reasons, a parallelized program in PIPS is no longer a
  classical PIPS program we can work on later because sequential code and
  parallelized code do not have the same resource type. Unfortunately,
  improving the parallelized code with some other transformations
  (dead-code elimination, etc) is also useful. Thus we add a new
  pseudo-transformation that coerce a parallel code into a classical
  (sequential) one to consider parallelization as an internal
  transformation in PIPS.

  Note this transformation may no be usable with some special
  parallelization in PIPS such as WP65 or HPFC that generate other resource
  types.
