The domain text is used to factor out of PIPS prettyprinter all layout
considerations. It does not depend on PIPS internal representation.

\domain{Text = sentences:sentence*}
{}

A text is a list of sentences.

\domain{Sentence = formatted:string + unformatted}
{}

Each sentence can be either formatted and the correspoonding string
must be printed out exactly as it is, or unformatted and line breaks
and indentation must be generated.

\domain{Unformatted = label:string x number:int x extra\_margin:int x  words:string*}
{}

Because of the Fortran origin, but it is also useful in C, a label can
be defined as a string for each sentence. The number field is the
statement number. The indentation is defined by field extra\_margin,
extra because of Fortran~77 fixed input fields. Finally a list of
words define the content of the sentence. The linefeed can be inserted
between two words and the continuation handled if necessary.

FI: I assume that the text library depends on the output language.

FI: Fabien Coelho has developped another interface to output source code.
