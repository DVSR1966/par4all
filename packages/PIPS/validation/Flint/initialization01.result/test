Proper effects for "INITIALIZATION01"

C     Check the piece of code added by Ronan to detect uses of
C     uninitialized variables

C     Results with real codes such as oa118.f and extr.f are garbage,
C     but it work for toy examples

C     Note that information gathered for the last print is garbage

C     Implicit variables such as __IO_EFFECTS:LUNS are a special case
C     that is not dealt with. And effects on LUNS are not well defined

      PROGRAM INITIALIZATION01
C               <must be read   >: I
C               <must be written>: J

      J = I                                                             0014
C               <must be written>: I
      I = 1                                                             0015
C               <must be read   >: I
C               <must be written>: J
      J = I                                                             0016
C               <must be read   >: J K L __IO_EFFECTS:LUNS(6)
C               <must be written>: __IO_EFFECTS:LUNS(6)
      PRINT *, J, K, L                                                  0017

C               <must be written>: I J K L __IO_EFFECTS:LUNS(5)
      READ *, I, J, K, L                                                0018
C               <must be read   >: J K L __IO_EFFECTS:LUNS(6)
C               <must be written>: __IO_EFFECTS:LUNS(6)
      PRINT *, J, K, L                                                  0019
