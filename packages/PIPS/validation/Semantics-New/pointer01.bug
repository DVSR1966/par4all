The anywhere effects are not taken into account by transformers. And they cannot be taken into account because there is no such transformer. We would need an anywhere transformer.

Besides, when effects are precisely computed with points-to information, transformers also ignore this information. value_mappings should include some of the virtual variables introduced by Amira to perform her points-to analysis.

Less work already done and more work still to be done than I expected.
