# The purpose was to make sure that the precompilation mecanism works
# for Fortran code and that errors are detected as expected. Because
# the workspace creation fails, the key user warning "Fortran syntax
# errors in file ./syntax_errors.f!" is lost because it is stored in
# file Warnings within a directory that is instantly destroyed.

# So the only way to get the useful message is to search the string
# "Fortran syntax errors in file" in the process output

# NOT PORTABLE AT ALL, DEPENDS ON THE FORTRAN COMPILER, if the
# compiler error message are checked too
