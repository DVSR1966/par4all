<<PRECONDITIONS>>
preconditions_inter_full;Default behaviour: compute transformers bottm up and then ... preconditions top down. The other posibilities are useless with powerful ... and medium size application.
preconditions_intra;Use cummulated memory effects instead of transformers to model call sites.
preconditions_intra_fast;Do not compute transitive closures for loops.
preconditions_inter_fast;Do not compute transitive closures for loops.
