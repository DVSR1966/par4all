PIPS validation, i.e. non regression tests.


Default validation (list of directories in "defaults"):

	sh> make validate

or just for one directory or one file:

	sh> make TARGET=Semantics validate
	sh> make TARGET=Semantics/loopequiv.f validate


To tell which tpips/pips should be used, you must give additional options
to "pips_validate" through the VOPT makefile macro:

	sh> make VOPT='-v -t /path/to/tpips -p /path/to/pips' validate

It can also be done by fixing the PATH environment variable:

	sh> PATH=/path/to/pips/binaries:$PATH make validate


Interactive acceptation of differences, possibly for some
directories or files, and commit:

	sh> make accept
	sh> make TARGET=Semantics accept
	sh> make TARGET=Semantics/loopequiv.f accept
	sh> svn ci -m 'what has been done...'


Full cleanup of generated files:

	sh> make clean


Convenient targets:

	sh> make validate-all
	sh> make validate-private
	sh> make validate-<replace-by-some-subdirectory>
