# ansi option added for newgen.

# ansi required for newgen (otherwise __STDC__ or __STRICT_ANSI__ not def).
CANSI	= -qlanglvl=ansi 

# -ma to allow alloca():
CFLAGS	= -g -O2 -qmaxmem=8192 -qfullpath -ma 

# if -E is ommitted, the file is *compiled*:-(
CMKDEP	= -E -M

# -lbsd added so signal work:
LDFLAGS	+= -lbsd

FFLAGS	= -g -O2 -u

# others

TAR	= tar
ZIP	= gzip -v9
