# Delete removes a list of workspaces whose names are provided
# after the command, no matter which the current workspace is.
# Filename generation rules can be used to expres the workspace 
# name, provided that special characters are quoted.
#
# Exemples equivalents:
# Delete foo
# Delete foo.database
# Delete foo.database/
# Delete `pwd`/foo.database
# Delete = Delete *.database
