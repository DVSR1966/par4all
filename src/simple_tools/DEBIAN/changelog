		* Par4All 1.0.4 introduces a new P4A Accel runtime.

		* In previous months, PIPS and PyPS has evolved a lot, specially
		  in the code generation for various accelerators. This version
		  cope with these evolutions.

		* Now the runtime can deal with subarray transfers between the
		  host and the accelerator, up to 4D arrays.

		* The code generation for CUDA pre-C99 is better/

        * Par4All 1.0.3 is a base version to be used from Windows in a
		  Wild Cruncher

		* NVIDIA_GPU_Computing_SDK is no longer needed to produce CUDA
		  code for nVidia GPU

		* Can now compile on Fedora

        * New option to use simpler #include recovery

		* Can move produced files to a given directory

        * Improved documentation

        * New options for Python code injection

        * Better error messages

        * Par4All 1.0.2

        * Clean up examples and their README files

            Added an option to run Hyantes example in single precision
            (for demos on laptops with small GPU)

        * Updated to current PIPS and PyPS version

        * --accel without --cuda works again for GPU emulation in OpenMP

        * Do not use new PyPS #include recovery

        * Recover any #include, not only standard ones (useful for Par4All
          Scilab)

        * Do not use PIPS capply by default when running phases

        * Added path normalization in p4a_setup so that configure can
          take relative path

        * p4a_validate post-processing utility updated to cope with new
          PIPS validation output
