For OpenCL, it would be nice to add some variable descriptor for the argument
in the kernel like __global. We will need __local to.
What about the __shared__ in Cuda ?

Many forms are possible for the kernel argument to
P4A_call_accel_kernel_2d: kernel file name, kernel name or kernel
source. They all are char *. Any problème of interface with PIPS ? It
was not the case with CUDA and OpenMP, as it was the function name
that was passed as argument.

Is it better to have the kernel in a separate file or in the same file
as the main program but in a string form ?

The kernel file (.cl) as the same name as the kernel_wrapper but with
the extension .cl.

l154 de p4a_accel_OpenCL.h : soucis à venir sans doute avec le type
des arguments à envoyer au kernel. Rest à voir et à améliorer ...
