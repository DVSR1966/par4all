<h1>HPFC: Summary of features</h1>

Last update: $Date$, .<p>

HPFC is a prototype High Performance Fortran Compiler which is being
developed within the <a href="/~pips">PIPS</a> project by
<a href="/~coelho">Fabien COELHO</a>.

<h2>Input language</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Fortran 77 (PIPS restriction)
  <li> static and dynamic mapping directives
       (but no array syntax) 
  <li> independent and dynamic directives
  <li> assumes a number of processors known at compile time
  <li> distributed arrays cannot be passed as arguments
       (but commons can be used)
</ul>

<h2>Output language</h2>
<ul>
  <li> host and SPMD node model
  <li> Fortran 77
  <li> runtime support library
  <li> PVM 3.3
</ul>

<h2>Implementation</h2>
<ul>
  <li> data structures based on NEWGEN
  <li> polyhedron manipulations based on the Linear/C3 library
  <li> 17,000 lines of C for the compiler (HPFC, a PIPS module) 
  <li> 1,000 lines of shell and C for the driver and other utilities
  <li> 3,000 lines of m4/fortran for the runtime support library
       (expanded to +8,000)
  <li> 2 programs are generated (host and SPMD node) and linked to PVM and
       the HPFC runtime library.
</ul>

<h2>Standard Optimizations</h2>
<ul>
  <li> on top of a basic run-time resolution scheme:
  <li> reduced allocation of distributed arrays on nodes.
  <li> overlapping accesses of block distributed stride-1 aligned arrays
       (overlapping declarations, vector messages, iteration set...)
  <li> subarray shifts of block distributed stride-1 aligned arrays
  <li> reductions on block distributed stride-1 aligned arrays
       (by name)
</ul>

<h2>Advanced  Optimizations</h2>
<ul>
  <li> linear algebra-based techniques...
  <li> I/O-related communications
       (<a href="doc/A-264.abstract">abstract</a>,
        <a href="doc/A-264.ps.gz">paper</a>)
  <li> remapping-related communications and optimizations
       (<a href="doc/A-277.abstract">abstract</a>,
        <a href="doc/A-277.ps.gz">paper</a>)
</ul>

<h2>Experiments</h2>
<ul>
  <li> The compiler is validated on +100 small or medium size codes
       for non regression testing every night.
  <li> SOR on a network of SUN workstations
       (<a href="doc/A-257.abstract">abstract</a>,
        <a href="doc/A-257.ps.gz">paper</a>)
  <li> wave propagation code from IFP on the SEH/ETCA CM5:
       problems with arithmetic exceptions and PVM (was 3.3.2).
  <li> matrix transpose on a DEC Alpha farm.
</ul>

<h2>Future work</h2>
<ul>
  <li> implementation of a linear algebra based technique
       (<a href="doc/A-278.abstract">abstract</a>,
        <a href="doc/A-278.ps.gz">paper</a>)
  <li> more experiments
</ul>
