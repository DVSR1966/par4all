<h1>HPFC: Summary of features</h1>

Last update: $Date$, .<p>

HPFC is a prototype High Performance Fortran Compiler which is being
developped within the <a href="/~pips">PIPS</a> project by
<a href="/~coelho">Fabien COELHO</a>.

<h2>Input language</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Fortran 77 (PIPS restriction)
  <li> static and dynamic mapping directives
       (only syntax based on dummy variables) 
  <li> independent and dynamic directives
  <li> assumes a number of processors known at compile time
  <li> distributed arrays cannot be passed as arguments
       (but commons can be used)
</ul>

<h2>Output language</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Fortran 77
  <li> PVM 3.3
  <li> runtime support library
</ul>

<h2>Implementation</h2>
<ul>
  <li> data structures based on NEWGEN
  <li> polyhedron manipulations based on the Linear/C3 library
  <li> 16,000 lines of C for the compiler
  <li> 1,000 lines of shell and C for the driver and other utilities
  <li> 2,000 lines of m4/fortran for the runtime support library
       (expanded to +8,000)
</ul>

<h2>Optimizations</h2>
<ul>
  <li> on top of a basic run-time resolution scheme:
  <li> declarations of distributed arrays on the nodes are reduced
       (but static)
  <li> overlapping accesses of block distributed stride-1 aligned arrays
       (overlapping declarations, vector messages, iteration set...)
  <li> subarray shifts of block distributed stride-1 aligned arrays
  <li> reductions on block distributed stride-1 aligned arrays
       (recognized by name)
  <li> I/O-related communications
       (<a href="doc/A-264.abstract">abstract</a>,
        <a href="doc/A-264.ps.gz">paper</a>)
  <li> remapping-related communications and optimizations
       (<a href="doc/A-274.abstract">abstract</a>,
        <a href="doc/A-274.ps.gz">paper</a>)
</ul>

<h2>Implementation overview</h2>
<ul>
  <li> <b>hpfc</b> is the compiler driver shell.
  <li> HPF directives are transformed into fake Fortran call
       to reuse the PIPS parser. Done thru a sed script that handles
       continuations...
  <li> These calls are filtered out of the parsed code and analysed to set
       internal data structures that describe array mappings and so.
  <li> New declarations are computed for the distributed arrays,
       depending on their mapping.
  <li> The input code is analysed by PIPS, which computes array regions and
       preconditions. 
  <li> Then 2 codes are generated for each subroutine. One for the host
       and an SPMD code for the nodes. This is implemented as a double
       rewriting of the AST of the initial program.
  <li> Initialization codes for the runtime data structures are also generated.
  <li> Finally the new declarations for the commons are generated
       (delayed because overlaps are only known after compiling all subroutines)
  <li> All the generated codes are put in a separate directory together
       with header files and Makefile.
  <li> A make in this directory compiles the 2 executables
       (host and nodes). They are linked to the
       pvm and hpfc runtime libraries
  <li> The host code can be launched. It spawns the nodes. 
</ul>

<h2>Experiments</h2>
<ul>
  <li> The compiler is validated on +70 small or medium size codes
       for non regression testing every night.
  <li> SOR on a network of SUN workstations
       (<a href="doc/A-257.abstract">abstract</a>,
        <a href="doc/A-257.ps.gz">paper</a>)
  <li> wave propagation code from IFP on the SEH/ETCA CM5:
       problems with arithmetic exceptions and PVM (was 3.3.2).
</ul>

<h2>Future work</h2>
<ul>
  <li> implementation of a linear algebra based technique
       (<a href="doc/A-267.abstract">abstract</a>,
        <a href="doc/A-267.ps.gz">paper</a>)
  <li> more experiments
</ul>
