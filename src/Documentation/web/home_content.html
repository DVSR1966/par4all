<a name="introduction"><h2>Introduction</h2></a>

<b>PIPS</b> is an automatic parallelizer for scientific programs. It
takes as input Fortran 77 codes and emphasizes interprocedural
techniques for program analyses. PIPS specific interprocedural analyses
are <a href="cnrs-nsf92/cnrs-nsf92.html">precondition</a> and <a
href="regions.html">array region</a> computations. PIPS computes affine
preconditions for integer scalar variables which are much more powerful
than standard constant propagation or forward substitution. PIPS also
computes several kinds of polyhedral array regions (READ, WRITE, IN and
OUT). PIPS is based on linear algebra techniques for analyses, e.g.
dependence testing, as well as for code generation, e.g. loop
interchange or tiling.

<p>

Analyses and transformations are driven by a make system, <a
href="pipsmake.html"><em>(pipsmake)</em></a> which enforces consistency
across analyses and modules, and results are stored for future
interprocedural use in a database by a resource manager,
<em>(pipsdbm)</em>. The compiler is made of phases that are called on
demand to perform the analyses or transformations required by the user.

Three user interfaces are available: a Shell interface <a
href="dret144/dret144.html"><em>(Pips)</em></a>, a line interface <a
href="line-interface.html"><em>(Tpips)</em></a> and a X-window
interface (<a href="wpips.html"><em>wpips man</em></a>, <a
href="wpips-epips-user-manual/wpips-epips-user-manual.html"><em>WPips
and EPips user manual</em></a>) to the parallelizer which is the best
suited for users.  Click <a

<p>

<b>PIPS</b> has been developped at <a href="/index-english.html">CRI</a>
since 1988, thru several research projects funded by the French DoD
(DRET), the French NSF (CNRS) and the European Union (ESPRIT
programs). The initial design was made by R&eacute;mi TRIOLET,
Fran&ccedil;ois IRIGOIN and Pierre JOUVELOT. This initial design has
proved good enough since then and has not required any major change. The
overview paper presented at <a href="Papers/ics91/ics91.html">ICS'91</a> still
is up-to-date, although major functionalities have been added since.

<p>

<b>PIPS</b> is built on top of two tools. The first one is <a
href="Newgen/newgen_manual/newgen_manual.html"><em>Newgen</em></a> which
manages data structures a la <em>IDL</em>. It provides basic
manipulation functions for data structures described in a declaration
file. It supports persistent data and type hierarchies. An introductory
<a href="Newgen/newgen_paper/newgen_paper.html">paper (in English) </a> and a
<a href="Newgen/tutoriel_newgen/tutoriel_newgen.html">tutorial (in French)</a>
are available.

<p>

All <b>PIPS</b> data-types are based on <em>Newgen</em>. A description
of PIPS internal representation is available in a <a
href="ri/ri.html">technical report</a>. The mapping of Fortran onto the
PIPS internal representation is described in Technical Report <a
href="dret105/dret105.html">TR E/105.</a>, Section 2.

<p>

The second tool is the <em>Linear C3</em> library which handles vectors,
matrices, linear constraints and structures based on these such as
polyhedrons. The algorithms used are designed for integer and/or
rational coefficients. This library is extensively used for analyses
such as dependence test, precondition and region computation, and for
transformations, such as tiling, and for code generation, such as send
and receive code in HPF compilation. The <em>Linear C3</em> library is a
joint project with IRISA and PRISM laboratories, partially funded by
CNRS. IRISA contributed an implementation of Chernikova algorithm and
PRISM a C implementation of PIP (Parametric Integer Programming).

<p>

New phases have been developped for distributed-memory machines, both in
house (WP65 and HPFC projects) and outside. A team at CEA, lead by
Benoit de Dinechin, contributed several phases which implement
techniques developped by Paul Feautrier (PRISM) for TMC CM-5 and Cray
T-3D machines, as well as extensions of these techniques (see <a
href="poly_meth.html">Polyhedric method</a>). These external phases were
easily blended within PIPS thanks to NewGen, which constraints the
number of data structures used by programmers and provide a general
framework for low-level classes (list, hash-table,...), and thanks to
<em>pipsmake</em> which hides the intra- and inter-procedural chaining
of analyses and transformations from the programmer as well as from the
user.

<p>

Seven years after its inception, PIPS as a workbench is still alive
and well. PIPS provides a robust infrastructure for new experiments in
compilation, program analysis, optimisation, transformation and
parallelization. The PIPS developper environment is described in a <a
href="developer_guide">technical report</a> but it also is possible
to develop new phases on top of but <em>outside</em> of PIPS since all
(in fact, most...) PIPS data structures can be reloaded using Newgen
primitives from C or Lisp programs.

<p>

PIPS can also be used as a reverse engineering tool. Region
analyses provide useful summaries of procedure effects, while
precondition-based partial evaluation and dead code elimination reduce
code size. 

<p>

PIPS is written in C and developped under SUNOS 4.1.4. PIPS can also
be used under SOLARIS 2. It is available on request for the source but
you can have an <a href="distribution.html">executable
idea of it</a>.
