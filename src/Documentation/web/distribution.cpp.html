<h1>PIPS Distribution</h1>

The PIPS software is distributed both in an executable form (for SUNOS4 and
for SOLARIS2) and at the source level. Note that the source code level is
fragile and big (200,000 lines of C code) and its compilation requires
many tools to be installed, thus we recommand that you rather download 
the compiled version if you do not plan to use pips as a base for
developing new analyses or transformations phases within the compiler.

When installing PIPS on your system, please read the INSTALL file at the
root directory of the distribution for further instructions on how to run
or compile pips. For help mail to 

<h2>PIPS executables</h2>

PIPS executables are available for SUN workstations, whether under SunOS
or Solaris.

<ul>
<li> <a href=distribution/pips_CBGNUpnle_961022.tar.gz>PIPS for SunOS4</a>
<li> <a href=distribution/pips_CBGNUSOL2LLpnle_961022.tar.gz>PIPS for SOLARIS2 (Ultra Sparc 64 bit integers version)</a>
</ul>

<h2>PIPS and tools at the source level</h2>

PIPS and tools PIPS is built upon are available at the source level.
Note that the code is distributed as is with no warranty, even implicit,
of any kind. It is distributed under the term of the GNU general license
that you may find quite easily on the net.

GNU make, cproto, flex, bison and some other tools are mandatory for
compiling PIPS. See the next section for pointers on how to find and
download these tools. 

<ul> 
<li><a href=distribution/pips_CSpnle_961022.tar.gz>PIPS sources</a>
	(includes Newgen and Linear)
<li><a href=distribution/pips_CSn_961022.tar.gz>NEWGEN</a>
	(software engineering tool)
<li><a href=distribution/pips_CSl_961022.tar.gz>LINEAR C3 library</a> 
	(integer linear programming)
<li><a href=distribution/pips_DDDp_961022.tar.gz>XPOMP</a>
	 (X-based 2D data graphical display)
</ul>

<h2>Other softwares of interest</h2>

Here are pointers to some external softwares that are used by PIPS or by
PIPS generated codes or for building the PIPS softwares. These sofwares
are generaly freely distributed.
