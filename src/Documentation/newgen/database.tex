\section{Old Database Structures}
 
\domain{Database = name:string x directory:string x resources:resource*}
{ The domain {\tt database} is used by pips-dbm
  to describe the state of a program user. This domain contains its
  name ({\tt name}), the directory in which it was created, and the
  information which was calculated for the different modules ({\tt
    resources}). In reality, the name of the database and the name of the
  directory used are in practice directly linked. The name of the
  directory is the name of the base with the string \textsc{.database}
  attached as a suffix.
 
An element of type {\tt resource} is added to the list {\tt resources}
of each objet calculed for this program by the phases, analyses or
transformations of Pips.
 
The library which makes use of this data structure is
\texttt{pipsdbm}. It should be named \texttt{database-util} if a
consistent file naming rule were used across PIPS development.
 
}
 
\domain{Resource = name:string x owner\_name:string x status x time:int x file\_time:int}
{ The domain {\tt resource} is used by
  pips-dbm to describe any piece of information which might be
  calculated by PIPS for a module or a program. For each bit of
  information, the following fields must be known: its resource kind
  name, ({\tt name}), the function to whom this resource is related to
  ({\tt owner\_name}), whether it is present in memory or stored in
  file ({\tt status}), its logical creation date ({\tt time}), and,
  portentially, the creation date (Unix) of the corresponding file
  ({\tt file\_time}).
 
The kind {\tt name} of the resource is in fact a type and could have been
defined as an enumerated type. It is out of concern for the simple and
generic nature of pipsdbm that we have chosen to define it as a
character string. It is this {\tt name} which permits a pipsdbm to
select the proper C function for reading, writing or freeing a resource.

At any given moment, each resource is identified in a unique manner by
its resource kind name, \texttt{name}, and the name of its so-called
{\em owner}, \texttt{owner\_name}.
 
We discussed for some time the utility of having an owner\_type to
specify what the resource refers to: a program (e.g. entities, the
symbol table), a module (most other resources), a
loop, an instruction, etc. We decided against it since to this date,
we only have those resources which may be attached to programs or
modules, and this information may be deduced from the kind {\tt name} of
the resource. In fact, we only have a few resources which may be
attached to a program; these are the entities (et les
\texttt{user\_file}, but they are largely poorly treated for the
moment). We also have summary information related to the whole
program, e.g. the program precondition.}
 
\domain{Status = memory:string + file:string}
{ The domain {\tt
    status} is used by pips-dbm to know if the resource concerned may
  either reside in memory, in which case it my be found either in
  memory, if it is needed for a processus, or on disc, if it is
  composed of a file which is normally never loaded in memory in the
  latter case, the sub-domain {\tt file} gives the file
  name.  The file name must be relative to the workspace, if it is
  found in this workspace, and must be absolute, if it is found
  outside of the workspace, in order to allow the operations
  \texttt{mv} and \texttt{cp -pr} in the workspace.  If the
  resource is in memory, the sub-domaine {\tt memory} contains a
  pointer towards this resource.
 
How do resources in a file and file resources differ? It cannot be seen
from this description! The list of the latter group is explicitely managed
somewherelsee in pipsdbm. File resources cannot be loaded into
memory. They are accessed through other files named after the resource
kind. For instance, the file PRINTED\_FILE contains the name of the
file containing the print-out of a function.

The pool of resources called database is often called the PIPS
workspace in PIPS litterature. It has been called a database initially
because a database can be memory resident.  The storage of a database,
i.e. a workspace, on disk is called a PIPS database or workspace. The
file structure of a workspace is described elsewhere (Fabien?). See
for instance the workspace slide in the PPOPP 2010 PIPS tutorial.  }
