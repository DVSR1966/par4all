\section*{Introduction}

This report present the data structures used to attach some
information to some word of text, mainly to use in the hypertext Emacs
interface.

\domain{import entity from "ri.newgen"}
\domain{import expression from "ri.newgen"}

\section{Attachments}

Are only a list of {\tt attachment}s:

\domain{attachments = attachment*}

\section{Attachment}

Here is what we can attach to a word:

\domain{attachment = attachee x begin x end}

{\tt begin} is the position of the attachment begin in the output
file and {\tt end} the position of its end.

The various objects that can be attached:
\domain{attachee = entity + unknown:unit}


\section{The mapping used to attach various internal informations}

%Each attachment point to a word of the code:
%\domain{attachment_to_word = attachment->string}

Each word can have a list of attachments:
\domain{word_to_attachments = string->attachments}
