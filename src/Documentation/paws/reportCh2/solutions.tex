\label{components_used}

This section provides information about specific solutions and workarounds used in PaWS application.

\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf Creating graphics} 
  
  Functional requirement No. \ref{req:dependence_graphs}, PaWS enables to create and present dependence graph. To create it in \emph{dot} \cite{dot_format} format\footnote{The DOT language is a description language for describing graphs in human and machine readable format.} there is PIPS mechanism used (shown in the listing \ref{DotDependenceGraphPrinting}).
  
  \lstset{language=Python,caption={Dependence graph in dot format printing},label=DotDependenceGraphPrinting}
  \begin{lstlisting}
function.print_dot_dependence_graph()
  \end{lstlisting}
  
  File in \emph{dot} format is transformed into image in \emph{png} format by command \emph{dot} of GraphViz Software\cite{graphviz}. Details can be found in \emph{dot} user manual: \url{http://www.graphviz.org/pdf/dot.1.pdf}.
  
  \item {\bf Presenting graphics} 
  
  To present dependence graphs the jQZoom Evolution\cite{jqzoom} library is used. This is light plugin based on JQuery (described in \ref{web_application_technologies}). It allows to present the image in more user-friendly way. There is small thumbnail\footnote{Thumbnail is the small illustration which represents the original image with much smaller size.} shown and hoovering mouse over it enables zooming preview of selected part of the original, big image. What is more, this plugin is very easy to usee, due to usage of JQuery, and to integrate with PaWS.
  
  The only potential problem of jQZoom usage is the need to provide two copies of the image in two sizes: big and thumbnail. To fulfill this requirement the Python Image Library (PIL) \cite{pil} is used. This is Python module which provides all the operations dedicated to images processing and supports many files formats. It is written in Python and hence is very easy to integrate in PaWS framework, which is its main advantage.
  
  \item {\bf Uploading files}
  
  According to the functional requirement No. \ref{req:uploading_files}, PaWS enables user to browse and pick his/her files. Uploading user files caused two problems:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item HTML ``input'' with \emph{type=``file''} used for uploading files is not customizable. That means that it is impossible to change the style of the button and file name label, which is causing aesthetic conflict with the rest of the HTML site.
    \item Uploading files through AJAX requests is impossible because of the browsers restrictions and XmlHttpRequest object limitations\cite{ajax_files_upload}. In the same time, PaWS needs to be able to upload user files without refreshing site. Since the stardard HTML solution is causing site refreshing, this requires the usage of AJAX.
  \end{itemize}
  
  The first problem is easy to solve by creating transparent files upload panel which covers false, styled panel (button and file name label). Due to that solution, only well styled button and label are visible but they are not active - invisible layer of not properly styled files upload panel captures users activity.
  
  The second problem is more serious, but has also been solved. There is a hidden, also transparent and invisible, IFrame used as a target for file uploading (``target'' attribute is used). When form with the file upload is submitted, the result will be present in hidden, refreshed IFrame, but it can not be seen by user. Content of this frame is copied to its proper destination (visible window). The last step is very easy and can be done without refreshing the whole site.
  
  \item {\bf Loading multiple files}
  
  The same requirement No. \ref{req:uploading_files} resutls in the possibility to load several user files packed in one archive file, using ``zip'' extension. The only restriction is that all files must be written in the same programming language. It is due to PyPS framework current limitations. 
  
  Python module \emph{zipfile}\cite{zipfile} is used to handle this case. It provides archive creating, reading, writing and listing.
  
  For each file a new tab is created and, when performing an operation, the user has to choose one specific function to analyse/transform. Dependence graphs are created for all functions from all the files.
  
  \item {\bf Printing result files}
  
  Functional requirement No. \ref{req:printing_results} imposes possibility of printing the results of the PIPS analysis and transformations. To print only the results, not a whole web page, a special hidden, user invisible frame is used. At user request, computation result is loaded into the invisible frame which is printed. 
  
  There is another possible solution for printing only part of a web page - usage of special style class which defines which parts of the site should be visible when the page is printed. Disadvantage of this approach is that it prints all of the page (even if bigger part of this is invisible) which causes large wasting of the space.
  
  \item {\bf Language detection}
  
  Functional requirement No. \ref{req:language_detection} refers to the language detection. It is based on simple tokens recognition. It can distinguish between C and Fortran only. 
  %% In addition, distinction between different versions of Fortran language (77 and 95) needs compilation.

  %% TO ADD: mechanism! Event when typing source code, pre-compilation
  
  \item {\bf Deleting temporary files}
  
  Most temporary files created during PaWS operations are deleted immediately after use. Unfortunately, there are also files which need to be kept on the server for a longer time. This applies to the files which are used to present results to user, graphs images or files with result of transformations and analysis for download. To preserve disk space on the server side (requirement No. \ref{req:deleting_files}), a cron\footnote{It is a customizable Linux job scheduler, which runs periodically user scripts or commands\cite{cron}.} task is used. Every hour, a Python script, \emph{pawsd.py}, located in \emph{pawsapp$\backslash$utils} directory, is invoked to delete all temporary files older than 2 hours.
