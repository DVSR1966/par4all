\chapter{Implementation}

PaWS is a very light and portable framework. This is achieved by using of multiple flexible and easy-to-extend technologies and tools, which are presented in this section. All aspects related to the implementation of PaWS are introduced such as architecture description and overview of specific solutions used. The last part of this chapter contains information about problems encountered during the development process.

Reading of this chapter is necessary to understand how PaWS is working. It is also a great introduction to the next section of this document (namely configuration of the PaWS framework).

\section{Conclusion}

Up to now, the architecture and the tools selected have met all the requirements (see Section \ref{design_requirements}) and design contraints (see Section \ref{design_contraints}).
