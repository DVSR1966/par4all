\section{Convex Hull}

\subsection{Definition}

Let $A$ et $B$ be two finite subsets of an affine or vector space $E$, the convex hull
of $A$ and $B$ is:

\begin{eqnarray}
\{ x ~ \in ~ E |
\exists~a~\in~A~~~\exists~b~\in~B~~~\exists~\lambda~\in~[0..1]~s.t. x =
\lambda a + (1 - \lambda b) \}
\end{eqnarray}

If $A$ or $B$ is not finite, the closure of the previous set is their
convex hull.

\subsection{Properties}

\begin{eqnarray}
A \subset A \vee A
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{eqnarray}
A = A \vee A \Longleftrightarrow A is convex
\end{eqnarray}

\subsubsection{Convex Hull and Intersection}

Since the computation of the convex hull of two sets is expensive, it would be nice to
reduce it by extracting common constraints and using the distributivity:

\begin{eqnarray} \label{equation-distributivity}
A \cap ( B_1 \vee B_2 ) = (A \cap B_1 ) \vee (A \cap B_2 )
\end{eqnarray}

Unfortunately, this property does not hold in general.

\label{figure-distrib01}
\end{figure}

For instance, look at figure~\ref{figure-distrib01}. The convex hull of
$B_1$ and $B_2$ is a segment which intersects $A$ whereas the
intersections of $A$ with $B_1$ and $B_2$ are both empty.

\begin{eqnarray}
A \cap ( B_1 \vee B_2 ) \not\subset (A \cap B_1 ) \vee (A \cap B_2 )
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{figure}

\mbox{\psfig{file=distrib02.idraw,width=0.8\hsize,height=0.8\vsize}}
\end{center}
\caption{The intersection should be performed first}
\label{figure-distrib02}
\end{figure}

The converse is not true either. In Figure~\ref{figure-distrib02}, the
intersection of $A$ with the convex hull of $B_1$ and $B_2$ is just $B_1$
and $B_2$. But the convex hull of $A \cap B_1$ and $A \cap B_2$ is the
diameter $[B_1 B_2]$.

\begin{eqnarray}
A \cap ( B_1 \vee B_2 ) \not\supset (A \cap B_1 ) \vee (A \cap B_2 )
\end{eqnarray}

If $A$ is convex (and $B_1$ abd $B_2$ are finite sets), then:

\begin{eqnarray}
A \cap ( B_1 \vee B_2 ) \supset (A \cap B_1 ) \vee (A \cap B_2 )
\end{eqnarray}

Proof: $x~\in~(A \cap B_1 ) \vee (A \cap B_2 )$ implies there exist $x_1$
and $x_2$ such that $x_1$ belongs to $A \cap B_1$ and $x_2$ belongs to $A
\cap B_2$, as well as $\lambda$$
in $[0..1]$ and $x = \lambda x_1 +
(1-\lambda) x_2$. Since $x_1$ and $x_2$ belong to $A$ and since $A$ is
convex, $x$ belongs to $A$ by definition of convexity. Furthermore, $x$$
belongs to $B_1 \cap B_2$ by definition of convex hull.

\label{figure-distrib03}
\end{figure}

If $A$ is a vector or affine subset, this is not a sufficient condition
for equation~\ref{{equation-distributivity} to hold.In
  Figure~\ref{figure-distrib03}, let $A$ be the $(Ox, Oy)$ plane and $B_1$
  and $B_2$ two lines intersecting $A$ in $X$ and $Y$$ respectively. The
  point $(1,1,0)$ belongs to the intersection of $A$ and the convex
  enveloppe of $B_1$ and $B_2$ but not to the segment $[B_1 b_2]$ which is
  the convex hull of the intersections of $A$ with $B_1$ and $B_2$, namely
  $X$ and $Y$ respectively.
