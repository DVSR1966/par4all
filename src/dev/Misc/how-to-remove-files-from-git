For example RaphaÃ«l Roosz commited more files than expected in the
pips-gfc branch of the PIPS svn.

So before importing it into the Par4All git, the files were to be removed,
because it complexify later merge with the unchanged files of GCC.

We work into the git repository constructed with a git-clone of the git
repository produced by a git-svn of his branch.

Construct the diff from his work against the gcc/fortran directory of gcc
4.4.1:

diff -q -w -r . ~/projets/Wild_Systems/Par4All/p4a.copie/packages/pips-gfc/gcc/fortran > ../gcc-diff

Construct the list of files in his branch:

ls >../ls-gfc

Construct a file files-to-remove with a list of files that should not be
into his branch by inspecting the files gcc-diff and ls-gfc

A=`cat ../files-to-remove | tr '\n' ' '`
git filter-branch --index-filter "git rm -r --cached --ignore-unmatch $A" HEAD
