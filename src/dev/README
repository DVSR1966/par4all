This directory contains some script used to build and manage the Par4All
framework itself.

p4a_setup : compile and setup the whole Par4All infrastructure


Some scripts to be used only once, but that are here because it was subtle
to set up and that can be used to add other parts to Par4All and may be
useful for other projects:

p4a_create_CRI_git_svn : build a git svn copy of the PIPS svn.

p4a_import_external_gits : add the external git repositories to Pa4All,
such as PIPS, polylib...

p4a_apply_pips_patches : used to patch the original PIPS files to fit the
  Par4All architecture. It should be used only once, after external GIT
  import

p4a_fetch_all : fetch all the remote git repository. For sanity reason,
the programmer is responsible to do the merge.
