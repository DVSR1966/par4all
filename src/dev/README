This directory contains some script used to build and manage the Par4All
framework itself.

p4a_setup : compile and setup the whole Par4All infrastructure


Some scripts to be used only once, but that are here because it was subtle
to set up and that can be used to add other parts to Par4All and may be
useful for other projects:

p4a_create_CRI_git_svn : build a git svn copy of the PIPS svn.

p4a_import_external_gits : add the external git repositories to Pa4All,
such as PIPS, polylib...
