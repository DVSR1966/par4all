# This is a simple generic validation test method to be used as a .test
# PIPS validation framework for p4a_recover_includes

# Note that .test can have any UNIX content so we use here to validate non
# PIPS stuff. :-) Ronan.Keryell@hpc-project.com

# The name associated to the .test file:
file_name=`basename $0 .test`

# The file name to be used to output the cpp processed instrumented content:
cpp=`mktemp --suffix=.cpp "$file_name"_XXXXXXX`

# The recovered result where we try to find again the #include's:
recovered=`mktemp --suffix=.c "$file_name"_XXXXXXX`

# Preprocess the example:
p4a_recover_includes --simple -E $file_name.c > $cpp

# Recover the top-level #include's:
p4a_recover_includes --simple -o $recovered $cpp

# Output on stdio the result for validation purpose by the PIPS validation
# framework:
cat $recovered

rm $cpp $recovered
