/* During the computation, the program has to deal with blocks of statements.

 *
 * With this new structure we know the current statement being translated
 * and the list of statements (ie the block) in which we put the new
 * statements created.

 * The list "last" is a truncated list from the current statement (included)
 * to the last.
 * The union of "first" and "last" is equal to the entire block.
 *
 * The boolean "stmt_generated" says if the current statement has:
 *       _ TRUE : already generated statements.
 *       _ FALSE : not generated statements.
 *
 * Thus, when the current statement generates a new statement it is put at the
 * end of the list "first" (just before the current statement).
 * The current statement gives its caracteristics to the new one if the bool
 * "stmt_generated" is FALSE; this allows to keep these caracteristics
 * at the first statement of the list generated by the translation of the
 * current statement.
 * The caracteristics of a statement are its "label", "number", "ordering" and
 * "comments" (cf. RI).
