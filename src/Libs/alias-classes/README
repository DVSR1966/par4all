Goal of the library

Compute points-to information for each statement, that is a relation
between pointers or set of pointers and memory locations.

Organization of the library

  passes.c   	pass definitions, interface with pipsmake and pipsdbm

  statement.c	recursive statement analysis

  expression.c	recursive expression analysis

  sinks.c	given a points-to in, compute the state of memory locations
                associated with a lhs expression

alias_classes.c
alias_lists.c
alias_pairs.c

constant-path-utils.c

  points_to_analysis_general_algorithm.c : initial algorithm, build incrementaly so as to have results quickly and to explore the problems

  points_to_init_analysis.c

  points_to_interprocedural_analysis.c

  points_to_prettyprint.c

  points_to_set.c	basic operation on points-to sets (~utils.c)

  prettyprint.c:

sav_alias_classes.c
sav_alias_lists.c

  emami.c: functions developed to implement Emami's algorithm
  assignment.c	analysis of assignment (statement or expression?)
