Points to improve in points-to analysis

No priority order.

1. Serious handling of conditions, starting with equality and disequality; see list06.c (altough its code looks dead wrong...)

2. C subscript construct analysis: see fulguro04.c

3. Convergence detection: current implementation no longer works as it used to

4. Add a new dimension to the graph expansion control: outgoing degree, shown in one of the list functions, the freeing of a list.

Done:

5. Connexion with effects_with_points_to: improve the points-to precondition or use a more powerful function in effects_with_points_to()? Or both?

-> I have enriched the points-to information (not sure yet it is enough)
