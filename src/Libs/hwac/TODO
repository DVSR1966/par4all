* pre
- inlining, full_unroll, dead code elim, flatten_code
+ image reuse
+ scalar deps with proper effects
- check => ok => deadcode (#define)

* input
+ may skip unrelated statements?
+ deal with |= ||= and similars
- what about full expressions: aipo_x() || aipo_y() || aipo_z()? atomizer?
- check that there are references where expected?
- check/remove more implicit hypothesis
- detect redundant operations? replace them with copies?

* code
+ cleanup data structures?
- record scalar deps in dag...
- remove type ctxcontent?

* output
+ symmetry (flipping)
+ compaction
+ handle wiring
+ tell pipsdbm about generated files
- the generated code is just a file to pips. ok???
+ pipe overflow
- add checks in generated code (img size and so)?
- parametric img size/depth? same as code?
+ show DAG!
+ select node shape depending on hardware?
+ add more comments to generated code
+ improve generated comments
- if only one image is used as input, put it anyway on both sides?
  may help some schedules if there are multiple successors.

* post
+ remove malloc/free if not used
+ cleanup declarations

* validation
- check all AIPO
- add more (elementary) tests?

* bugs
