# Semantics Analysis

#
# This library supports intra and interprocedural semantic analysis.
# It is entirely based on linear systems, although they are not necessarily
# fully used. Different level are available:
#
# The subpackages are:
#
#  - ri_to_transformers contains functions which compute transformers for
#    a module and all its statement; the only visible function should be
#    module_to_transformer(); it assumes that the module code is loaded
#    and that a control graph was computed and that effects are available;
#    it does not call itself recursively when encountering a programmer
#    CALL; it is NOT recursive; the prettyprinter library contains a
#    function to print a module with its transformers;
#
#  - ri_to_preconditions contains functions which compute preconditions
#    a module and all its statements; the only visible function should be
#    module_to_preconditions(); same prerequisites as module_to_transformers()
#    plus, of course, transformer availability; the prettyprinter library
#    contains a function to print a module with its preconditions;
#    the routine module_to_preconditions() and module_to_transformer() are
#    separated to cope with interprocedural analysis: transformers are
#    computed bottom up and preconditions top down on the call graph
#    (no Fortran recursivity is expected)
#
# A main program, main.c, provides an easy way (i.e. dbxtool compatible) to try
# semantic analysis and to test the library
#
# Source, header and object files used to build the library.
# Do not include the main program source file.
