Here are given small examples showing how to use p4a, tpips and pyps to
parallelize some code.

People only interested in quick results should look only at examples using p4a.

- P4A directory contains basic examples that use p4a directly to generate
  OpenMP or CUDA parallel programs:

  - Hyantes : a geographic application on potential smoothening

- F77_matmul_OpenMP shows how to use the PIPS command line interface tpips
  for advanced user but also simple p4a for Fortran

- Python contains examples for bleeding edge users that want to tailor
  Par4All to their own needs by dynamically changing the behaviour with
  some Python injections.
