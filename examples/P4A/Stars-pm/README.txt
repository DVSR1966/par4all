Stars-pm is a particle-mesh N-body cosmological simulation, written by
Dominique Aubert and Mehdi Amini.


Here we present 5 different executions of the same C sequential code:

- the native one: sequential execution using the FFTW3 library for
  accelerated FFT on multiprocessors;

- automatic parallelization with p4a for parallel execution on multicores
  with OpenMP that is automatically generated by p4a combined with the
  already parallelized multithread FFTW3 library;

- automatic parallelization with p4a --cuda for parallel execution on
  nVidia GPU + automatic wrapping of FFWT3 library to cuFFT on GPU

- automatic parallelization with p4a --cuda --com-optimization which is
the same as the previous one but with the optimization of communication
between host and GPU.

- the manually converted in Cuda code. 

The CUDA versions use atomic operations and require a GPU with compute 
capability > 1.1. Moreover Stars-pm CUDA version make use of Fermi 
features and is not optimized for legacy GPU.

You need to have the fftw3f library installed (the libfftw3-dev package on
Debian/Ubuntu) to be able to link the code, and optionally OpenGL and/or
GTK for visualization. You also need a recent Cuda SDK for cuda build.

  make seq : build the sequential program from the C sources
  make openmp : build the openmp program from the C sources
  make cuda : build CUDA version
  make cuda-opt : build CUDA version with communication optimization
  make cuda-manual: build the manually written CUDA version

To get an output you might add opengl=1 and/or gtk=1 on cmd line, for instance
"make seq opengl=1".
You might also run "make clean" first to force rebuilding.

You can set the P4A_OPTIONS variable to pass some options to p4a.

  For example, globally with an:
  export P4A_OPTIONS='--nvcc-flags="-G"'
  or locally with:
  make P4A_OPTIONS='--nvcc-flags="-G"' run_cuda

You can then execute the produced binary using files in "data/". There's bench
for 3 size of datas (32,64, and 128). Default size if 128, the others can be obtained
 by adding SIZE=32 or SIZE=64 to the makefile command line.

The run is now done simply with ./stars-pm_{suffix}{_size}[_options] data/exp{size}.a.bin

Have a look at *.sh file in current directory for example.
