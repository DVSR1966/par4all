Some Par4All benchmarks:
========================


You can build different versions of these test cases, the sequential
version, the OpenMP automatically parallelized version, the na√Øve CUDA
version, and the same CUDA kernels with optimized communications.  We ship
also PGI and HMPP versions for each of these cases.

The targets at top level are respectively "seq", "openmp", "cuda",
"cuda_opt", "pgi", "hmpp".
They build and run all test cases.

If you want only one, for instance polybenchs/2mm, then go in 2mm
subdirectory and run "make 2mm_seq" ; "make 2mm_openmp" ; ....

You can run the test cases using "make run_seq" ; "make run_openmp" ; ....
It generate the executable too if needed.

Execution time in milliseconds is recorded in a SQLite database (if
sqlite3 is available) or in a .csv file.
The measure doesn't include array initialization (we suppose the main
process is intended to be part of a larger framework) but will include all
communications.

You can personalize the name of the version for a run (no space
allowed) with for instance:
VERSION="Cuda-optimized-12-august" make run_cuda_opt

The scripts/generate_speedup.sh script can generate a gnuplot script that
draws the speedup from the SQLite database. It can be parameterized with
environment variables, for instance :

dbfile=my.timing.sqlite tests="2mm hotspot99 correlation" ref_ver="The_reference_version_name" versions="Cuda-optimized-12-august Cuda-naive OpenMP OpenMP-Fine" ./scripts/generate_speedup.sh

Here is the list of possible params:

  dbfile: name of sqlite db, default to timing.sqlite

  tests: spaces separated list of testcase, default to all tests in the DB

  ref_ver: speedup will be computed taking this version as reference,
  default to "run_seq"

  versions: spaces separated list of version to display, default to all
  available in the DB

  exclude_tests: spaces separated list of testcase to exclude, default to
  "", cannot be used with 'tests' option

  disable_mean: disable geometric mean display in the histogram, default
  is "" (activated)

  title: set a title for the gnuplot graph

  labelfontsize: set fontsize for label
