You can build 4 differents versions of these test cases, the sequential version, the openmp automatically parallelized version,
the naive cuda version, and the same cuda kernels with optimized communications.

The targets at top level are respectively "seq", "openmp", "cuda", "cuda_opt". It'll build all test cases. If you want only one, for instance polybenchs/2mm, then go in 2mm subdirectory and run "make 2mm_seq" ; "make 2mm_openmp" ; ....

You can run the test cases using "make run_seq" ; "make run_openmp" ; ....

Measure in milliseconds is recorded in a sqlite database (if sqlite3 is available) or in a .csv file. A script can generate an histogram with the speedups.
