Combinatorial tests of freia spoc scheduler and wiring.
1005 cases are considered, reduced from 6912 thanks to
symmetries and the constraint that temporaries are used.

To run this validation:
  sh> ./schedule_combi.pl --usetemps --symmetry
  # generate 1005 files
  sh> for f in freia_*.c ; do mkdir ${f/.c/.result} ; done
  sh> make validate
  # there should be no coredumps, i.e. no remaining databases
  sh> rm -rf freia_*.result
  sh> rm -f freia_*.c
