PIPS validation, i.e. non regression tests.


Default validation or just for one directory:

	sh> make validate
	sh> make TARGET=Semantics validate
	sh> make TARGET=Semantics/loopequiv.f validate


To tell which tpips/pips should be used, you must give additional options 
to "pips_validate" through the VOPT makefile macro:

	sh> make VOPT='-v -t /path/to/tpips -p /path/to/pips' validate

It can also be done by fixing the PATH environment variable:

	sh> PATH=/path/to:$PATH make validate


Interactive acceptation of differences, and commit:

	sh> make accept
	sh> svn ci


Full cleanup of generated files:

	sh> make clean
