PIPS validation, i.e. non regression tests, bugs and expected enhancements.

xxxx: non-regression test for functionality xxx,
    may or not use PIPS initial default settings
xxxx-Bugs: known bugs (corrective maintenance)
xxxx-Future: new functionalities (evolutive maintenance)
xxxx-New: non-regression test for functionality xxx,
    using the current defauolt settings for properties and activates


Default validation, i.e. non-regression tests
  (the list of directories in "defaults")

	sh> make new-validate

or just for one directory:

	sh> make TARGET=Semantics new-validate

or just for one file:

	sh> cd Semantics
	sh> rm loopequiv.result/test
	sh> make loopequiv.result/test


To change the pips/tpips used for the validation, fix the PATH,
and possibly LD_LIBRARY_PATH if you use dynamic linking:

	sh> PATH=/path/to/pips/binaries:$PATH make new-validate


Acceptation of differences, possibly for some directories or files, and commit:

	sh> svn ci -m 'what has been done...' test-files-to-accept


Full cleanup of generated files:

	sh> make clean parallel-clean
