Par4All is an automatic parallelizing and optimizing compiler (workbench)
for C and Fortran sequential programs.

The purpose of this source-to-source compiler is to adapt existing
applications to various hardware targets such as multicore systems, high
performance computers and GPUs or some parallel embedded heterogeneous
systems.

It creates new OpenMP, CUDA or OpenCL source codes and thus allows the
original source codes of the application to remain mainly unchanged for
well formed programs.

Par4All is an open source project that merges various open source
developments.

With `Wild Cruncher
<http://www.silkan.com/more-about/#wildcruncher>`_
from `SILKAN <http://www.silkan.com>`_ it is also possible to compile and
parallelize `Scilab <http://www.scilab.org>`_ programs to speed up
computations.
