Fortran to OpenCL parallelization
=================================

Master or engineer internship

**Keywords**: compilation, parallelization, Fortran, OpenCL, program
 transformations

Manycore processors and heterogeneous accelerators allow good performance
on parallel programs with good power efficiency but their programming is
quite challenging.

There exist some frameworks to ease application development on these
platforms and Par4All (http://par4all.org) is one of them, based on
automatic parallelization that can parallelize C and Fortran sequential
programs to OpenMP, CUDA and OpenCL.

Unfortunately, Fortran support is quite limited and we focus with this
internship on adding more support for Fortran 95 though the GNU/gfortran
front-end to PIPS (http://pips4u.org) and restructuring the Par4All core
to be more extensible and to deal more languages.

This internship can be followed by a job or a PhD thesis.

Some knowledge useful for this project: compilation, C, Fortran, Python, Unix.
