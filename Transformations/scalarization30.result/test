C     First example, which turns out to be wrong if the program
C     behaviors must be rexpected

      SUBROUTINE SCALARIZATION30(A,B,M,N)
      REAL A(N), B(M)

C     a(i) is not scalarized because m<1 is a guard for it. Adding s =
C     a(i) before do j = ... may generate out of bounds accesses that do
C     not exist in the initial code
      DO I = 1, N
         DO J = 1, M
            A(I) = A(I)+B(J)
         ENDDO
      ENDDO

C     Let's make sure that the inner loop is executed
      IF (M.LT.1) STOP

C     The result is copied out for the next loop nest
      DO I = 1, N
         __scalar__0 = A(I)
         DO J = 1, M
            __scalar__0 = __scalar__0+B(J)
         ENDDO
         A(I) = __scalar__0
      ENDDO

C     The inner loop is certainly executed when the outer loop is entered
      DO I = 1, N
         __scalar__1 = A(I)
         DO J = 1, N
            __scalar__1 = __scalar__1+B(J)
         ENDDO
C     No copy out because of the interprocedural analysis: no caller here
      ENDDO

      END
