Preconditions are affine predicate over scalar variables. They are
used for dependence testing, interprocedural convex array analysis,
inteprocedural constant propagation, control simplification and
possibly property dependence proving. By default, only integer
variables are analyzed, but boolean, string and float scalar variables
can also be analyzed.
